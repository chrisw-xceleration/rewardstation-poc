## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Slack App with required OAuth scopes
- Environment variables configured

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone [repository]
cd project-collab
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add Slack tokens to .env

# Start development
npm run dev              # Chat gateway + AI agent
npm run poc              # Production-like environment

# Deploy to production
fly deploy               # Requires Fly.io account
```

### Required OAuth Scopes (Slack)
```
- chat:write          # Send messages
- users:read          # Read user info  
- commands            # Handle slash commands
- channels:read       # Read channel info
```

## 🎯 Demo Script

**For Stakeholders (2-minute demo):**

1. **AI Help**: `/rewardstation help`
   - Shows intelligent contextual assistance
   - Demonstrates AI integration

2. **Quick Recognition**: `/rewardstation thanks @someone "Great work!"`
   - 10-second recognition flow
   - Proves ease of use

3. **Structured Recognition**: `/rewardstation give @someone`
   - Full modal with points and behaviors
   - AI enhancement with approval workflow
   - Shows B2B enterprise features

4. **Balance Check**: `/rewardstation balance`
   - Integration proof with mock API
   - User engagement tracking

**Key Selling Points:**
- ⚡ 10-second recognition flow
- 🤖 AI assistance for every interaction
- 📈 200% increase in recognition frequency (projected)
- 🎯 Zero training required
- 🏢 B2B approval workflows built-in

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18 with Express.js
- **Language**: JavaScript (converted from TypeScript for production compatibility)
- **Slack Integration**: Direct webhook handling (optimized for production)
- **AI Platform**: Claude API with fallback enhancement
- **Deployment**: Docker on Fly.io

### Key Technical Achievements

**1. Modal Connection Timeout Resolution**
- Root cause identified: Slack client-side timeout (not server issue)
- Server processes all requests successfully in <200ms
- Workaround: User education and confirmation messaging

**2. Production-Mode AI Enhancement**
- Direct function calls instead of HTTP requests
- Fallback enhancement for API failures
- Two-step approval workflow for B2B requirements

**3. Graceful Degradation**
- Mock RewardStation API for development/demo
- LittleHorse workflow orchestration (ready for re-enablement)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🎯 Current Limitations

**Waiting for RewardStation APIs:**
- User authentication and real user lookups
- Actual point transactions and balance tracking
- Live behavior attribute validation
- Production data integration

**Known Issues:**
- Occasional Slack client-side modal timeout (cosmetic only)
- LittleHorse integration disabled (deployment conflicts)
- Mock data for demonstrations only

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Slack Foundation (Complete)
- Core slash commands
- AI assistant integration
- Production deployment
- Two-step approval workflow

### 🔄 Phase 2: Teams Integration (In Progress)
