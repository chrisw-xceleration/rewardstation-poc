## Option 2: Update via App Manifest

### 1. Go to App Manifest
In your Slack app settings, click **"App Manifest"** in the left sidebar

### 2. Replace with This Manifest
```yaml
display_information:
  name: RewardStation POC
  description: AI-powered recognition platform with Maslow Insights
  background_color: "#4A90E2"
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: RewardStation
    always_online: true
  slash_commands:
    - command: /help
      url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events

      should_escape: false
    - command: /thanks
      url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events
      description: Quick 25-point appreciation
      usage_hint: '@user "your message"'
      should_escape: false
    - command: /give
      url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events
      description: Opens modal for formal recognition (50-500 points)
      usage_hint: '@user'
      should_escape: false
    - command: /balance
      url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events

      should_escape: false

      description: Legacy command (use new simplified commands)
      usage_hint: 'help | thanks @user "message" | give @user | balance'
      should_escape: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - chat:write
      - channels:read
      - commands
      - im:write
      - users:read
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    request_url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
    request_url: https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
```

### 3. Save and Reinstall
1. Click **"Save Changes"**
2. Go to **"Install App"**
3. Click **"Reinstall to Workspace"**

## Verification Checklist

After updating, verify:
- [ ] All 4 commands show in Slack when you type `/`
- [ ] Each command has the correct URL: `https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events`
- [ ] The app has been reinstalled to your workspace
- [ ] The following OAuth scopes are granted:
  - `chat:write`
  - `channels:read`
  - `commands`
  - `im:write`
  - `users:read`

## Test Commands
Once updated, test in any Slack channel:
```
/help
/balance
/thanks @someone "test message"
/give @someone
```

## Troubleshooting

If still getting "dispatch_failed":
1. **Check URL**: Must be exactly `https://rewardstation-poc.fly.dev/slack/events`
2. **Check Reinstall**: App MUST be reinstalled after adding commands
3. **Check Workspace**: Make sure you're in the right Slack workspace
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the app has the required OAuth scopes

## Why This Is Happening

The server code is ready and working, but Slack's app configuration hasn't been updated. Slack needs to know:
1. What commands exist (`/help`, `/thanks`, `/give`, `/balance`)
2. Where to send them (our server URL)
3. That the app has permission to use them (reinstall grants this)

Once you add these commands in the Slack API dashboard and reinstall the app, everything will work!
